# Maryland High School Sports Championship Records Dataset - Cross Country
## Introduction
This repository contains historical championship data for Maryland high school
sports, compiled from Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association
(MPSSAA) records.
## Contents
The dataset `championships.csv` contains the following columns:
The data reveals the school, year, class, gender, and sport. In alphabetical order, all schools with records are listed for championships they won in what class and what year. The columns also specify boys and girls.
## Methodology
### Data Collection
Using the previously made record-books, I scraped data and used an AI language model to organize the data by the set columns, setting them up alphabetically. I transferred the data into a textfile, which was later turned into a csv file. The process was simple, as I was able to get each school with records done, and eventually scrape for the individuals records as well.
### Data Organization
The data was organized in the simplest form possible, which just reveals columns that indicate school, year, sport, gender and class. This makes it the easiest to digest. I had the language model organize it that way in alphabetical order.
## Caveats
### Known Data Limitations
### Missing Data
For the most part, this data features most of the needed information, as the data reveals all of the championships for each school and when they took place. I was able to get all of the necessary information. The only things missing might be the location of events and other miscellaneous things.
