# Maryland High School Sports Championship Records Dataset - Swimming & Diving 

## Introduction

This repository contains historical championship data for Maryland high school sports, compiled from Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) records.
## Contents

The dataset `championships.csv` contains the following columns:
School, Year, Status, Sport, Gender, Season. All schools are listed in order from which year their won each championship, also what gender and status the school ended in.   

## Methodology

### Data Collection

Using the Maryland High School Champion Record Books, I extracted images from the record books and imputed them into a language model. I used ChatGPT, but the process was pretty tedious. I found that taking smaller images and typing "extract the data from this image and make a csv file at the end. However make the column names: " as my template, made the process so smoother for me. 

### Data Organization

The data was organized in columns "School, Year, Status, Sport, Gender, Season". This made it easier for the language model and me to keep up with the data collection 

## Caveats

### Known Data Limitations

### Missing Data

There is no missing data in the championship data or the meet records for the individuals. However, I still need to add the boys state individual records and one more page for the girls.
